# Kehan(Khloe)'s Web Blog application
Welcome to my blog! I have deployed it on Cardiff University's OpenShift server,  
the URL: http://c-22092126-cmt-120-cw-2-git-c22092126-cmt120cw2.apps.openshift.cs.cf.ac.uk/  
Currently only CU network and CU VPN user can get access to it but I'll deploy it to a public server in the future.  
# Features
